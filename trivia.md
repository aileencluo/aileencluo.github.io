<!-- ===== Calligraphy ===== -->
<h2 id="calligraphy" class="section-title">Calligraphy</h2>
<p>
  I study East Asian calligraphy as a meditative practice and as an extension of aesthetic 
  philosophy. The discipline of brushwork reflects balance, patience, and form that resonates 
  with philosophical inquiry.

<!-- ===== Pottery ===== -->
<h2 id="pottery" class="section-title">Pottery</h2>
<p>
  Pottery connects material craft with timelessnessâ€”shaping clay mirrors shaping thought. 
  My explorations in ceramics highlight texture, imperfection, and the philosophy of wabi-sabi.
</p>

<!-- ===== Sake ===== -->
<h2 id="sake" class="section-title">Sake</h2>
<p>
  I study the cultural and ritual significance of sake in Japanese tradition, connecting 
  artisanal brewing with ideas of community, ceremony, and philosophical reflection on taste.
