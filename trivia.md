<!-- ===== Calligraphy ===== -->
<h2 id="calligraphy" style="font-size:1.6em; margin-top:40px; border-left:4px solid #1B3A57; padding-left:10px;">Calligraphy</h2>
<p>
  I picked up calligraphy when I was about six years old, and it has quietly remained part of my life ever since. For me, itâ€™s less about producing perfect strokes than enjoying the calm and focus that come with brush and ink.

<!-- ===== Sake ===== -->
<h2 id="sake" style="font-size:1.6em; margin-top:40px; border-left:4px solid #1B3A57; padding-left:10px;">Sake</h2>
<p>
  I enjoy exploring the world of sake, both its flavors and the culture that surrounds it. Tasting different brews has been both a delight and a learning journey, and somewhere along the way I picked up a certification as an Intro Sake Sommelier.
