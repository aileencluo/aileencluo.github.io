<!-- ===== Calligraphy ===== -->
<h2 id="calligraphy" style="font-size:1.6em; margin-top:40px; border-left:4px solid #1B3A57; padding-left:10px;">Calligraphy</h2>
<p>
  I started learning calligraphy when I was about six, and it’s been a quiet companion ever since. For me, it’s less about perfect strokes than about the calm and creativity that come with brush and ink.

<!-- ===== Sake ===== -->
<h2 id="sake" style="font-size:1.6em; margin-top:40px; border-left:4px solid #1B3A57; padding-left:10px;">Sake</h2>
<p>
  I love exploring the world of sake: the flavors, the traditions, and the stories behind each brew. Tasting different varieties has been both a joy and a learning experience, somewhere along the way I earned a certification as an Intro Sake Sommelier.
