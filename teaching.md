<p>My teaching spans both traditional philosophy and contemporary topics at the intersection of AI and computer science. I aim to bring historical insight and rigorous conceptual frameworks into dialogue with modern technical developments.</p>

<p>Teaching experience in philosophy includes courses and seminars on Kant, early modern philosophy, moral and political theory, and the history of psychology. I emphasize close textual reading, argument analysis, and connecting classical texts to present-day debates.</p>
