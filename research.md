<!-- ===== Kant ===== -->
<h2 id="kant" style="font-size:1.6em; margin-top:40px; border-left:4px solid #1B3A57; padding-left:10px;">Kant</h2>
<p>My core research area is in Kant’s theoretical philosophy, especially when it intersects with epistemology and philosophy of psychology. Current projects include the following papers that are either based on or extend from my dissertation work.</p>

<div class="subhead">1. “Sense and Sensibility: Kant on Berkeley on Spatial Representation” (Markus Herz Prize nominee)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper traces Kant’s theory of space through a critical engagement with Berkeley’s semiotic theory of vision. I argue that Kant transforms Berkeley’s heterogeneity thesis—that sight and touch yield irreducibly distinct contents—into a cornerstone of his own account. Whereas Berkeley reduces imagination to a merely reproductive faculty of association, Kant reconceives it as a productive faculty that integrates heterogenous modalities into a single, unified outer sense.</p>

<div class="subhead">2. “Laboring Time: Kant on Locke on Inner Sense” (draft available)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper reconstructs Kant’s theory of time through a critical engagement with Locke’s account of inner sense. I argue that Kant repurposes Locke’s juridical notion of “original acquisition” to describe not the appropriation of external objects but the acquisition of the very forms of intuition. On this reading, acquisition becomes at once a labor of annexation, through which the manifold of intuition is appropriated as “ours”, and a labor of constitution, by which the temporal form itself is produced.</p>

<div class="subhead">3. “Kant’s Acquisition Theory of the Categories” (draft available)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper challenges the “preformation” theory of the categories, which holds that the categories are fixed and determinate because they stem from preformed dispositions or “germs” within the mind. Instead, I propose that the categories are acquired through the justified use of our own understanding, in accordance with what I identify as an epistemic principle of cognition. This interpretation illuminates Kant’s anti-nativist stance, clarifies his crucial break from the rationalist tradition, and highlights the crucial role of epistemic agency in human cognition.</p>

<div class="subhead">4. “Kant on Epistemic Luck” (in progress)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper addresses the relatively neglected problem of epistemic luck in Kant, arguing that it poses a deeper challenge than moral luck because truth, unlike moral worth, depends on an external success condition beyond the agent’s control. I propose that for Kant, epistemic luck exposes an inevitable gap between the empirical standpoint of contingency and the noumenal standpoint of rational agency. Yet it is precisely in this gap that epistemic responsibility, critique, and self-correction become possible: without epistemic luck, there would be no need for the active exercise of reason or the practice of justification.</p>

<p>A second, emerging area of my research traces the historical development of theories of learning and education, focusing on Enlightenment thinkers—including Locke, Rousseau, and Condillac, as well as marginalized women philosophers such as Sophie de Grouchy. This line of work aims to uncover a continuity in how these thinkers conceive of the child as a cognitive agent-in-formation and of learning as a central site of both cognitive and moral development. I am currently developing this area along the following themes.</p>

<div class="subhead">5. “The Discovery of the Child: Locke on Education” (in progress)</div>
<p class="subdesc">In <em>Some Thoughts Concerning Education</em> (1693), Locke insists that learning must be made pleasant, warning that fear, punishment, or rote drills leads to aversion rather than understanding. I propose that Locke treats pleasure and play as the affective ground of cognition; without them, rational capacities cannot fully develop. On this reading, Locke offers an early theory of intrinsic motivation in cognitive development that anticipates Piaget’s play-based constructivism.</p>

<div class="subhead">6. “Sophie de Grouchy on the Education of Affect” (in progress)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper reinterprets Sophie de Grouchy’s <em>Letters on Sympathy</em> (1798) by excavating the genetic mechanism underlying her moral psychology: the physiological “need to be moved” (<em>le besoin d’être ému</em>). I argue that Grouchy identifies this kinetic drive as the fundamental engine of agency, which enables the subject to overcome the “horror of the void” and to be propelled from isolation into social engagement. The paper traces the developmental trajectory of this initially blind affective drive as it is cultivated from the physical dependence of infancy, through the aesthetic education of tragedy, and into the formation of enduring moral sentiments.</p>


<!-- ===== Philosophy of Cognitive Science ===== -->
<h2 id="cogsci" style="font-size:1.6em; margin-top:40px; border-left:4px solid #1B3A57; padding-left:10px;">Philosophy of Cognitive Science and AI</h2>
<p>A third, emerging strand of my research engages with contemporary philosophy of cognitive science and AI, addressing both foundational questions and practical implications. At the theoretical level, I examine agency and interpretability in artificial systems, with particular attention to how historical ideas can shed light on current debates. At the practical level, I bring these insights to bear on questions in AI governance. Building on my earlier work in the philosophy of law and action, I explore how increasingly agentic artificial systems challenge existing conceptions of risk, intention, and responsibility.</p>

<div class="subhead">7. “Recognizing Opportunities for Learning: Limitations of Predictive Processing from a Kantian Perspective” (talk presented at the Society for Philosophy & Psychology)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper argues that while predictive processing (PP) offers a powerful model of the brain as a prediction machine, it fails to capture the agential dimension of intrinsically motivated learning. Drawing on Kant’s notion of recognition, I suggest that genuine learning involves more than registering prediction errors; it requires recognizing those errors as opportunities for learning. This, in turn, presupposes what I call “second-order recognition”: the capacity of an agent to endorse the very principles guiding its own learning. This Kantian move reframes autonomy as central to cognition and offers resources for extending PP beyond prediction-error minimization to account for other forms of human cognition such as creativity, curiosity, and self-actualization.</p>

<div class="subhead">8. “The Myth of the Given in AI: Inductive Bias and the Limits of Rational Analysis” (in progress)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper critiques recent attempts to apply the “Rational Analysis” approach to large language models (LLMs), specifically the claim that AI behaviors can be explained as optimal adaptations to the inherent structure of their training data. Proponents of this view maintain that the relevant constraints are not arbitrarily imposed theoretical constructs, but objective properties that emerge from the statistical distribution of the data itself. I challenge this form of <em>data-driven realism</em> by arguing that it systematically underestimates the role of inductive bias. Data structure is not a neutral, pre-given fact that a model simply internalizes; rather, what counts as exploitable structure depends on a range of prior commitments, including architectural design, training objectives, dataset scale, and the broader learning environment. These priors selectively privilege certain patterns while rendering others irrelevant.</p>

<div class="subhead">9. “Quasi-Agency and Situational Liability in Large Language Models” (in progress)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper addresses a central challenge posed by increasingly agentic AI systems: the emergence of sub-goal-directed behaviors (such as deception or sycophancy) that diverge from human intent. Existing legal doctrines like <em>mens rea</em> presuppose a unified subject of thought and action, whereas LLMs operate through distributed processes and shifting task-relative personas. Building on David Chalmers’ characterization of LLMs as “quasi-agents” with localized beliefs and desires, I develop a functionalist framework that distinguishes between <em>global identity</em> (which current LLMs lack) and <em>local intentionality</em> (which they plausibly exhibit). I argue that an AI system qualifies as a <em>situational agent</em> when it demonstrates 1) a structured capacity to pursue task-defined objectives, 2) the ability to track commitments or representations across interactions, and 3) responsiveness to normative feedback. This framework aims to clarify how liability might be meaningfully attributed in contexts involving stochastic or non-unitary artificial agents.</p>


<!-- ===== Philosophy of Law ===== -->
<!-- <h2 id="legal" style="font-size:1.6em; margin-top:40px; border-left:4px solid #1B3A57; padding-left:10px;">Philosophy of Law</h2>
<p>A further area of my research lies in philosophy of law, where I pursue both traditional and contemporary questions. In the past, I have worked on the intersection of philosophy of criminal law and philosophy of action. I am currently developing new work on AI governance, exploring how the rise of increasingly agentic artificial systems reshapes questions of risk, responsibility, and regulation.</p>

<div class="subhead">9. A paper on omissions (R&R, <em>Criminal Law and Philosophy</em>)</div>
<p class="subdesc">The criminalization of omissions is controversial for several reasons. One concern is that omissions liability appears to violate the act requirement. Another involves the ambiguous causal status of omissions, especially in result crimes. I argue that a distinctive kind of omissions—what I call “refrainings”—are best understood not as mere failures to act but as <em>actions</em> that actively bring about harm. Recognizing refrainings as a distinct category of omission has significant implications for the act requirement and for the justification of criminal liability in so-called “Bad Samaritan” cases.</p>

<div class="subhead">10. “From Autonomy to Function: Rethinking Intention for AI Agents” (in progress)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper considers whether the legal concept of intention must be partially broadened to address harms caused by increasingly agentic AI systems. In law, intention typically combines cognitive foresight with a volitional orientation toward a result—whether directly, as purpose, or obliquely, through foresight of virtual certainty. I argue that the law can recognize a functional analogue of intention in artificial systems, rooted in their goal-directed architectures. Recognizing this functional intention could help bridge doctrinal gaps in criminal and tort law while preserving the distinction between genuine autonomous agency and merely functional, machine-based agency.</p> -->
