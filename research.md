<!-- ===== Kant ===== -->

<p>My core historical research area is in Kant’s theoretical philosophy, especially when it intersects with epistemology and philosophy of psychology. Current projects include the following papers that are either based on or extend from my dissertation work.</p>

<div class="subhead">1. “Sense and Sensibility: Kant on Berkeley on Spatial Representation” (Markus Herz Prize nominee)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper traces Kant’s theory of space through a critical engagement with Berkeley’s semiotic theory of vision. I argue that Kant transforms Berkeley’s heterogeneity thesis—that sight and touch yield irreducibly distinct contents—into a cornerstone of his own account. On this reading, spatial representation is not a “fleeting shadow” of the divine mind but an <em>a priori</em>, multisensory intuition that secures the very distinction between reality and illusion.</p>

<div class="subhead">2. “The Making of Time: Kant on Locke on Inner Sense”</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper reconstructs Kant’s theory of time through a critical engagement with Locke’s account of inner sense. I argue that Kant repurposes Locke’s juridical notion of “original acquisition” to describe not the appropriation of external objects but the acquisition of the very forms of intuition. On this reading, inner sense is not merely a passive mirror of mental operations but emerges only through its reciprocal relation to outer sense.</p>

<div class="subhead">3. “Kant’s Acquisition Theory of the Categories”</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper challenges the “preformation” theory of the categories, which holds that the categories are fixed and determinate because they stem from preformed dispositions or “germs” within the mind. Instead, I propose that the categories are acquired through the justified use of our own understanding, in accordance with what I identify as an epistemic principle of cognition. This interpretation illuminates Kant’s anti-nativist stance, clarifies his crucial break from the rationalist tradition, and highlights the crucial role of epistemic agency in human cognition.</p>

<div class="subhead">4. “Kant on Epistemic Luck” (in progress)</div>
<p class="subdesc">This paper addresses the relatively neglected problem of epistemic luck in Kant, arguing that it poses a deeper challenge than moral luck because truth, unlike moral worth, depends on an external success condition beyond the agent’s control. I propose that for Kant, epistemic luck exposes the inevitable gap between the empirical standpoint of contingency and the noumenal standpoint of rational agency. Yet this gap is precisely where epistemic responsibility, critique, and self-correction could arise.</p>

<p>A second, emerging area of my research traces the historical development of theories of learning and education, with a focus on figures such as Locke, Rousseau, and Piaget. This line of work aims to uncover a continuity in how these thinkers conceive the child as a cognitive agent-in-formation and how learning functions as a crucial site of cognitive development. I am currently developing this area along the following themes.</p>

<div class="subhead">5. “The Discovery of the Child: Locke on Education”</div>
<p class="subdesc">In <em>Some Thoughts Concerning Education</em> (1693), Locke insists that learning must be made pleasant, warning that fear, punishment, or rote drills leads to aversion rather than understanding. I propose that Locke treats pleasure and play as the affective ground of cognition. On this reading, Locke offers an early theory of intrinsic motivation in cognitive development that anticipates Piaget’s play-based constructivism.</p>

<div class="subhead">6. “Piaget on the Decentering of Consciousness”</div>
<p class="subdesc">In <em>The Child’s Conception of the World</em> (1929) and <em>The Child’s Conception of Physical Causality</em> (1930), Piaget describes children as initially “egocentric,” unable to distinguish their own perspective from that of others. He argues that decentering—overcoming egocentrism—arises through social interaction and the coordination of perspectives. I propose that this developmental shift parallels Kant’s distinction in the <em>Prolegomena</em> between judgments of perception, which are merely subjective, and judgments of experience, which claim objective validity. On this reading, Piaget offers a developmental analogue to the transition from subjective to objective judgment.</p>


<!-- ===== Philosophy of Cognitive Science ===== -->

<p>Investigating questions raised by contemporary cognitive science, including representation, consciousness, and computational models of the mind. The aim is to integrate rigorous conceptual analysis with empirical insights.</p>

<div class="subhead">Paper 1 — Levels of Computation & Explanation</div>
<p class="subdesc">Clarifies levels-based explanation in cognitive models, situating computational, algorithmic, and implementational claims within a single normative frame.</p>

<div class="subhead">Paper 2 — Perception, Prediction, and Concept Use</div>
<p class="subdesc">Connects predictive processing accounts with concept acquisition and perceptual learning, arguing for a principled link between inference and representation.</p>

<div class="subhead">Paper 2 — Responsibility, Agency, and Evidence</div>
<p class="subdesc">Explores agency-sensitive models of responsibility and how evidential standards can reflect underlying normative commitments.</p>
