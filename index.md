    <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Aileen C. Luo</strong>, a scholar working at the intersection of Kantian philosophy, cognitive science, and modern thought. My research engages with classical texts while seeking connections to contemporary debates in epistemology, philosophy of mind, and aesthetics.</p>

    <p>I also have teaching and research interests that bridge philosophy with AI and computer science, reflecting on both historical and forward-looking perspectives. This site provides a window into my essays, projects, teaching materials, and reflections.</p>
