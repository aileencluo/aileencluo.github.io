<p class="subdesc"><em>Making History Alive</em> is an ongoing public philosophy initiative that brings the history of philosophy into dialogue with contemporary issues in science, technology, and society. Its aim is to make philosophy’s past a living resource for understanding the present, through short essays, interviews, collaborations, and multimedia features that show how classic ideas continue to shape our intellectual and moral world.</p>
